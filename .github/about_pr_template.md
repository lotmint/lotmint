**About the pull request template**

This template is written primarly to provide a friendly reminder of important
things to consider and that we easily forget. This should help us keep some
level of code quality.

In the "what this PR does" section, the user must remove one of the two lines.
We leave the option to only use the commit message for simple PR, or add more
explanations starting with a "This PR" sentence.

The checklist is not intended to be exhaustive and should NEVER contain more
than 10 points. If we later want to add another point, we should then decide to
remove the least important one.

Points should be (more or less) factual rather than philosophical, so that a
user can easily check them against its code and update it if needed. For
example, adding a point *leave the code better than you found it* is a nice
sentence, but it's hard to assess.
