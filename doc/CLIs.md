This is a list of CLIs in the cothority that can be used to interact with
existing conodes:

- [status](../status/CLI.md) query the status of a cothority server
- [blscosi](../blscosi/blscosi) request and verify collective signatures using BLS Cosi
- [scmgr](../scmgr/README.md) skipchain manager to inspect a running skipchain
- [evoting](../evoting/evoting-admin) run an election on a decentralized system using
skipchains to store the votes
part of the bzycoinx protocol
- [pop](../pop/CLI.md) create and participate in Proof-of-Personhood parties
where each participant gets a cryptographic token that identifies him
